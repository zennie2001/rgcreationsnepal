    {/* Strengths */}
    <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow duration-300 border-l-4 border-[#133950]">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold uppercase mb-4">Strengths</h3>

    {/* Weaknesses */}
    <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow duration-300 border-l-4 border-[#133950]">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold uppercase mb-4">Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Selective Project Range:</strong>We primarily focus on premium, large-scale projects and do not take on low-budget or small-scale developments. While this upholds our quality standards, it limits our potential client base in mid-tier markets.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher Entry Cost for Clients:</strong> Our high-quality finishes and custom solutions may not be accessible to clients with limited budgets.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    {/* Opportunities */}
    <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow duration-300 border-l-4 border-[#133950] ">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold uppercase mb-4">Opportunities</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Expanding Urban Nightlife Scene: </strong> Rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles in Nepal and South Asia are increasing the demand for premium hospitality and entertainment spaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Partnership with Landowners:</strong>  Our build-lease-partner model opens doors to landowners who want to capitalize on their property without managing the business.</li>
        <li><strong>Franchise or Licensing:</strong> Offering our design and execution model as a franchise could help expand our brand across cities without overextending operationally.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainable Construction:</strong> Integrating eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient systems can attract socially conscious clients and open doors to green building certifications.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    {/* Threats */}
    <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow duration-300 border-l-4 border-[#133950] ">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold uppercase  mb-4">Threats</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Market Saturation in Urban Areas:</strong> Major cities may soon become saturated with similar offerings, increasing competition.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Instability:</strong>In times of economic downturn, luxury and hospitality projects are among the first to be postponed or canceled.</li>
        <li><strong>Rising Construction Costs:</strong> Global fluctuations in material prices and supply chain delays can impact project timelines and profitability.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Changes:</strong> Zoning, safety, or hospitality licensing changes could affect ongoing or planned developments.</li>
      </ul>
